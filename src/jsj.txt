                    <p>Robotics Inc. is a CRUD web app built over the course of one week while attending
                        Fullstack
                        Academy. This was a solo project assigned to students immediately after we had finished
                        learning all the full stack technologies in the FSA curriculum. Tech used includes
                        React,
                        Redux, Express, Sequelize and PostgreSQL.

                        This my first full stack web app built from start to finish. It served me by really
                        helping
                        to solidify all of the concepts, at every level of the stack, that I had learned in the
                        prior six weeks or so.</p>
